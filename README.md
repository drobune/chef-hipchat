## Description

This cookbook provides a `hipchat_msg` resource, making it easier for chef recipes to send messages to a chat room on Atlassian's HipChat service.


## Platform

Should work on any platform where Chef runs. Tested on Ubuntu.

## Requirements

* Chef version 11.10 or greater (JSON gem version conflicts)
* Authentication token for an existing HipChat account.
* 'hipchat' gem (automatically installed by this cookbook's default recipe).

## Actions

* `speak` - do it (the default)
* `nothing` - don't do it

## Attributes

* `api_version` - version of hipchat api to use. allowed values are 'v1' and 'v2' (defaults to 'v1').
* `room` - the name of the room you would like to speak into (requied).
* `token` - authentication token for your HipChat account (required). Please note that auth tokens are tied to api versions (e.g. v1 tokens will not work with v2 api).
* `nickname` - the nickname to be used when speaking the message (required).
* `message` - the message to speak. If a message is not specified, the name of the `hipchat_msg` resource is used.
* `notify` - toggles whether or not users in the room should be notified by this message (defaults to true).
* `color` - sets the color of the message in HipChat. Supported colors include: yellow, red, green, purple, or random (defaults to yellow).
* `failure_ok` - toggles whether or not to catch the exception if an error is encountered connecting to HipChat (defaults to true).
